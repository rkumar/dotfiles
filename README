vimrc.20101019 is my original vimrc.

Then I moved to spf13 and then moved back.

So the current $HOME/.vimrc links to vimrc.minimal. which takes from
the vimrc.20101019 but uses bundles and tries to be conditional in loading them.
vimrc.20101019 moved moves moving moved moving moved
moved 20101019
